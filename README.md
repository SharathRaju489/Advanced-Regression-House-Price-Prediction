## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

- Which variables are significant in predicting the House Prices that will benefit the company.
- How well those variables describe the House prices



## Conclusions

- Based on the requirement, the company shouls focus on purchasing houses below the market value by concentrating more on the negative parameters.
- And by improving the above variables abd mentioning the high valued positive variables they can make profits
- Above grade (ground) living area square feet is contributing highly to the SalePrice
- Good and excellent exterior and basement quality is better sold
- Places in Northridge, Northridge Heights and Stone Brook locations are low in demand and thus sold slower and for lower rates
- 1 is the Optimum value for lambda in ridge regressiog
- 100 is the Optimum value for lambda in lasso regression
